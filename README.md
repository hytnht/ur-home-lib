# YOUR HOME LIBRARY


## About

This is the final project for CS50 Introduction to Computer Science by Havard University. The concept is a website to
manage your book collection, focused on series tracker. It was inspired by my big bookshelves of which more than half
are manga series. It's hard to find the missing volumes if I forgot to buy, even for a short time. So my first idea was
to create a tool to keep tracking and automatically update the current book series status.
